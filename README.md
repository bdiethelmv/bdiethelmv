Hi, I’m Benjamin Diethelm-Varela. I'm a pharmacist and pharmaceutical scientist from Chile.

- I’m interested in science! Especially health sciences, but I also love astronomy, computer science, data science and statistics.
I was trained as a pharmacist, and did graduate research in medicinal chemistry, so I have a reasonable grasp of pharmacology, chemistry, and biology.
My favorite operating system is Linux (GNU/Linux. Sorry Mr. Stallman). My favorite Linux distro is Debian. My favorite programming language is Python. 
I also know a bit of R and SQL.
I am interested in open-source software and open data projects!

- I’m currently pursuing deeper learning on programming languages (emphasis on Python) and statistics.

- I’m looking to collaborate on education projects, data analysis tasks, and any open-source endeavor where my skills might be useful. I work well
with others so feel free to reach out if you think I can be of help in your project!

- How to reach me: try either bmdiethelm@gmail.com or bmdiethelm@uc.cl. I check those regularly. Also, feel free to contact me through GitHub, Reddit

Did you know that if you fold a sheet of paper 100 times its length will be 13 billion light years (length*2^100)? Exponential growth gets out of control quickly.
Don't try at home; within a few foldings you will pierce through your roof.
