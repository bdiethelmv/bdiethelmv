Hi, I’m Benjamin Diethelm-Varela. I'm a pharmacist and scientist from Chile. Welcome to my GitHub page!

About me: 

- My areas of interest are health sciences, microbiology, and immunology, but I also love astronomy, computer science, data science and statistics.
I was trained as a pharmacist, and did graduate research in medicinal chemistry, so I have a reasonable grasp of pharmacology, chemistry, and biology.
My favorite operating system is Linux. My favorite Linux distro is Debian. My favorite programming language is Python. 
I also know R and a bit of SQL.

- I’m currently pursuing deeper learning in immunology, clinical research, and statistics. I was recently admitted to a PhD program in Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, so that training will continue for a while.

- I’m looking to collaborate on education projects, data analysis tasks, and any open-source endeavor where my skills might be useful. I work well
with others so feel free to reach out if you think I can be of help in your project!
